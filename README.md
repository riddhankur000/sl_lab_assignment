# KrishiMitra - SL lab project
KrishiMitra is a farmer-centric platform that brings transparency and fairness in agricultural pricing. The system collects daily crop prices from multiple sources, including government portals, state mandi boards, private marketplaces, and crowdsourced farmer inputs. It allows farmers to compare regional prices, calculate transport-adjusted profits, and find the best nearby market to sell their produce. The platform also highlights regions where farmers are underpaid, enabling NGOs and policymakers to take timely action. Unique features include local language support, voice-based assistance, government scheme updates, and a community forum for farmers to share experiences. Empowering farmers with real-time, reliable information reduces exploitation by middlemen and promotes fair trade, better income, and sustainable agriculture.
